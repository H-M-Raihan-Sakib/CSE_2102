Bubble Sort

There is a vector array named "a" initialized with some value in unsorted format.

1) set i := 0
2) repeat steps 3, 4 while i < a.size()
	3) set j := i+1
	4) repeat steps 5 and 6 while j < a.size()
		5) if a[i] >= a[j] then : 
			INTERCHANGE between a[i] and a[j]
		else Continue 
			[END OF IF]
	6) set j  = j + 1
		[END OF LOOP]
	7) set i = i+1
		[END OF LOOP]
8) WRITE vector array "a" and exit
